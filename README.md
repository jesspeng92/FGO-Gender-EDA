# FGO-Gender-EDA
This project is a webscraping and exploratory data analysis project analyzing gender and other features in FGO.
The data was scraped off of https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Fate/Grand_Order_Wikia . 

## Requires Editing
The data was scraped as of 6/23/2022. Servants added to the game after this date have not been added
Some of the information in the csv are incorrect due to multiple NP Charge ATK values and misteps in separating these values. I'll try to go back and fix them at a later date.

## Sources and Inspiration
Some of my sources and inspiration include Neptunia's <a href="https://github.com/neptunia/vtubers-data-science"> Vtuber and Superchat</a> analysis and Kevin Wang and Nick Zhang's <a href="https://kevinw1008.github.io/">Probability and Financial Impact of Gacha Games</a> featuring Genshin Impact.
